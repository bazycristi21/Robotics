Laboratory homeworks


For the second homework we'll need:  
a. 1 RGB LED  
b. 3 potentiometers  
c. 3 resistors  
d. Wires  
e. Arduino  
f. Connector cable  
  
We'll read the values of the potentiometers and use each value to directly control one of the RGB colors.  
  
  
  
For the third homework we'll need:  
a. 1 passive buzzer for knock detection  
b. 1 active buzzer for sound  
c. 1 pushbutton  
d. 2 resistors for buzzers  
e. Wires  
f. Arduino  
g. Connector cable  
  
Using the knock we'll detect knocks and after 5 seconds after the knock, we'll start a buzzer tone.  
We will use the pushbutton to stop the tone.  
  
  
  
For the forth homework we'll need:  
a. 1 4 digit 7-segment display  
b. 1 joystick  
c. Resistors  
d. Wires  
e. Arduino  
f. Connector cable  
  
We will controll individualy each digit of the segment with the joystick. Using the X-azis, cycle through the digits and chose which one to modify. Light up the DP led of the current position. After that, use the Y- axis to modify the value of the digit, both up and down. Press the button again to unlock the selection and be able to cycle through the 4 digits again.
