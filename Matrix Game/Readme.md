# Maze

## Short Description

The game will start with a dot representing the player and a part of a maze. The task for the player is to get out of the maze.
The road to the exit can be found by surveilling all the parts of the maze. There is just one road that goes to the exit of the maze.
If the player hits a wall or the margin of the maze the level will restart. 
There will be multiple levels and the dificulty will grow with each level.

## Gameplay

In each level, the player starts in the left-up corner, and his task in order to get to the next level and finally win the game is to get in the right-down corner.
There are 4 levels.
The first level is the tutorial.
On the first 2 levels the player can see the full level on the initial matrix.
On the last 2 levels the player will see just 1/4 of the level and he needs to move through the walls and remember what he saw before, using that to get out of the maze.
All the levels have time pressure. The player should finish the level before he runs out of time.
The last level has a increased difficulty. The road to the exit is hard to find and there is no so much time.
In each level there are points that the player needs to get in order to get a big score.
The score points are represented by blinking dots. 
## Tips
