# Slippery Box

## Description

### It's a game in which the player needs to move a yellow box by tilting the whole system in that particular direction that he wants. The idea of the game is to touch the green points (which will increase your score) and to avoid the red ones and also the blue margins of the game. At the moment, the game has only 1 game mode : Infinity. In this game mode the player needs to get as many points as he can until the time is over. In the future another game mode will be implemented: Campaign.

## Requirements for the project

#### 1. 128px x 128px LCD display  (for rendering the game)
#### 2. 32px x 256px LCD display   (for the menu)
#### 3. Joystick 
#### 4. Accelerometer - MPU6050

## How to play

### The game starts with an animation and the display becomes blue. After that, the player, represented by a yellow box (11x11 px) will spawn in the middle of the display and will observe 1 green (6x6 px) dot and 1 red (5x5 px) dot. The player can move the box by tilting the system in the way that he wants the box to move. Be careful and don't touch the blue margins. The task is to get as many green points as you can, without touching the red ones or the blue margins. Each play has 30 seconds, after that the game will end with an animation and the display will become red. Each green point that you take will give you 2 points. After finishing the game if you have a new record score you can write your name and it will be saved in the highscore menu.
